History of changes for @NAME@ for IDEA @IDEA-VERSION@

@VERSION@ from 1.0.0-RC2
Bug Fixes
- Reads Java options from all prior versions of the plugin. The text of the
  notice and the file location are restored. All other values used their new
  defaults.
- The ipr and iml files are no longer modified if there are no changes to the
  copyright settings.
- Ensure only supported languages appear under the File Types tab of the
  configuration screen.
- Fixed internal error when clicking on the Apply button of the settings screen.

New Features
- There is now a project level setting for disabling the plugin. This defaults
  to disabled so no copyrights are added to any files by default. This can be
  turned on in the template project if you would rather have all new projects
  have the plugin enabled by default.
- Added mnemonics to the configuration screen.
- Added back Update Copyright menu item to end of the editor context menu.
- You can now copy project level settings into a module. Useful if you want to
  create module specific settings similar to the project settings.
- You can now import copyright settings from any project or module on the local
  file system. The settings can be imported at the project or module level.

1.0.0-RC2 from 1.0.0-RC1
Changes
- You can now specify either block or line comments regardless of what the
  language supports. If the language doesn't support the choice then the choice
  is emulated with the supported syntax.
- Dollar signs ($) are now escaped when the copyright notice is persisted in
  the ipr and/or iml files. This allows for the use of CVS tags in the
  copyright notice.

New Features
- You can now specify a character used to fill separators. If nothing is
  specified a sane default is used appropriate to the language.
- You now have the option of using XML comment syntax for JSP files.

Bug Fixes
- The Validate button became enabled incorrectly under certain conditions.

1.0.0-RC1 from 0.2.1
New Features
- This completely new version supports adding copyright notices to Java, XML,
  HTML, xHTML, JSP, JSPx, CSS, DTD, and Properties files. You may specify a
  template copyright notice to be used by all file types without the need to
  change the text for each type of file.
- This plugin is compiled with Java 1.5 so you must be sure IDEA is executed
  with JDK 1.5.0 or greater.

0.2.1 from 0.2.0
New Features
- The Project level Copyright settings now works similar to the Version Control
  settings dialog. This dialog allows you to specify both project and module
  level settings.
- Module level settings can now be set to one of three modes. 1) Module specific
  copyright notice, 2) Use Project level copyright notice, or 3) No copyright
  notice at all.

0.2.0 from 0.1.5
New Features
- Support for IDEA Irida (5.0.x).
- Module level Copyright settings.
- Added Overview tab to setting pane. This describes the plugin and the valid
  macros for the Velocity template.
- Add support for any combination of block and end-of-line comments for the
  copyright notice.
- Added new macro variable $module.name.

0.1.5 from 0.1.3
Bug Fixes
- Changed name to "Copyright" from "CopyrightPlugin Plugin".
- Fixed threading issue that could cause a mangled new class if a user chooses
  to have Idea create a new class via pressing Alt-Enter on an unknown class.

0.1.3 from 0.1.2
New Features
- Added "Replace" options on Copyright configuration screen. This is used to
  specify which comments get replaced if there are more than one comment in the
  selected copyright notice area. First indicates that only the first comment
  will be replaced. Last indicates that only the last comment will be replaced.
  And All indicates that all comments will be replaced with the copyright
  notice. Under no circumstances will the main class' Javadoc comment ever get
  removed or replaced.
- Comments that were really Javadoc comments are now properly replaced or
  removed as appropriate. Again, the true class Javadoc comment will never be
  removed or replaced.
- Update Copyright menu option available from the module node of the project
  and package trees.

0.1.2 from 0.1.1
